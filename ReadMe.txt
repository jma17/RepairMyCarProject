I wanted to make a game that was fun to play and incorporated my prompt in it. My prompt was to use a mysterious coin, a broken tail light and a cigarette vending machine. I feel like I accomplished what I set out to do. A time that I was stuck was adding an ending that only ended when a NPC had multiple parts. I tried multiple things but it didn’t work. Luckily Mr. Kiang was there and could help me solve the problem. The first puzzle is an NPC puzzles with a hurt runner. He tells you that he is cramping and needs water. You have to go to the store and get some water for him. In return, he gives you a mysterious coin. The next two puzzles are finding coins for the vending machine. I put one of the coins in the toilet in the bathroom. The toilet is undescribed though. You have to read the graffiti on the wall in order to know there is a toilet there. Once you get the coin, you can put it in the vending machine. The other coin is hidden in some trash by the curb. You have to examine the trash in order to find the coin. You then put it in the machine like the other ones. During the beta process, Chris and EJ tested my game. They tried to ask the car repair guy about things that I didn’t about. I added responses to these questions in my game. They also found some grammar errors in my game. When EJ played my game, the coins disappeared from his inventory. I found the error and fixed it. They helped me polish my game to look better. In return I beta tester their games. I liked Chris’s idea for his game but it wasn’t fully completed. I couldn’t cut open the mattress for some reason but it was still fun to play. I told him to add more items to his other rooms do the game would be more complete. I also showed him some grammar errors. Ej’s game was also fun to play. I liked his combination puzzle for making a sledgehammer. I may want that code for future games. I helped him with thinking of more items for his rooms and helped him with grammar errors. I am most proud of my vending machine in my game. It works really well and I am amazed how much inform can do. Next time, I think I will add a combination puzzle to my game to make it more interesting. I think I would also want to make a puzzle with a spinning code.
